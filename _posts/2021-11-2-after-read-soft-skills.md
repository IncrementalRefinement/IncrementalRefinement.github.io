title: After Read Soft Skills
tags: [Methodology, Time Management]
---

This blog is mainly for summarize my understanding of the book **soft skills the software developer's life manual**. I haven't finished reading all the chapters, so i left them with mark TODO

I try to write this blog in English, but found myself terribly naive about that currently. I might get some more exercise and do more reading XD

## Section1 Career

The main idea of this chapter is that: the software developer should treat their career as a business. When you start to think of yourself as a business, you start to make good business decisions. In that case, the business growth and product marketing is of great concern.

## Section3 Learning

One of the most important skills a software developer can learn is the skill of self-teaching. We can divide self-teaching into 10 steps:

1. Get the big picture
2. Determine scope
3. Define success
4. Find resources
5. Create a learning plan
6. Filter resources
7. Learn enough to get started
8. Play around
9. Learn enough to do something useful
10. Teach(can be done in many ways, writing blog, recording video, discuss with others, etc.)

The step 1-6 will be done only once. But steps 7 through 10 are repeated for each module you end up creating in your learning plan. 

## Section4 Productivity

1. Use momentum to get focus, eliminate distraction
2. Divide big goals into smaller ones, and make them concrete
3. yearly plan --> quarter plan --> monthly plan --> daily plan
4. Measure the working hour, and 
5. Develop habits
6. Just do it
