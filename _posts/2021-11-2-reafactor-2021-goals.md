title: Refactor My 2021-2022 Goals
tags: [Plan]
---

After read Book **Soft Skills**(see my last post), I realized the plan I made before is not satisfying. So I refactor my yearly plan, and post it. The mainly modification is that:

1. I make some vague plan more concrete.
2. I downgrade/upgrade some goals so that they become more reasonable.
3. I break some larger plan into smaller parts.
4. I made some routine work more concrete and practical

## Rules

1. only write blog in English

## Half Year Plan

1. CFA
2. IELTS/TOEFL
3. Espana test
4. Gain more offer to prove the CS study plan
5. lose weight to 60kg and maintain
6. Some plan without quota will be discussed later, after I do some investigation

### Quarter1

1. finish r-core
2. finish CMU-15445
3. finish at least 80% Graduation thesis
4. lose weight to 63kg

### Quarter2

// TODO

## Routine

I make quota standards for routine work

1. Run 3 times a week, 4km
2. work 6 Pomodoro clock a day
3. leet code daily and weekly contest
4. reading 1h at night

The schedule above will be adjusted as executed
